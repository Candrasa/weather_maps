# weather_maps

This repository contains a python notebook for making basic weather maps from online data.  Should work for 1 Jan 1979 through the current time (most recent available run of the GFS).

You should be able to run the notebook directly through binder and adjust the time and lat-lon region to whatever you like:

This is an initial attempt, so if you find any bugs, please let me know at Mathew_Barlow@uml.edu.  Over time, I will be adding more variables and more plots, and improving the quality of the graphics.  Here are the current maps, for the March 1993 "Superstorm."
